# BART_API
**Summary:**

This was the final project presented by myself and team (Github: BeginnerDave, DanielJacob, joeender, SirhcG) for Software Engineering I (CS4310) at Cal State East Bay.  We decided to do an Android app using an open API because none of us had used these technologies before.  It took us eight weeks, but we managed to have most of the endpoints covered, and a nice looking user interface.  Personally I build the functionality out for getting train routes and details.  Learning about XML and Document Builder Factory were my biggest points of satisfaction.  Other than that it was another cup of Java.

We acknowledge that using the generic API key was a bad thing...
